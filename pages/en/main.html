        This project is designed to store a list of repositories and applications, </br>
    you need a new installation of Ubuntu operating system family. </br>
    I've been wanting to do similar (already in 2010), but all hands did not reach. </br>
    And now, some free time and I started this project. </br>
        The project is written entirely in GoLang, source code can be downloaded from my page <a href="https://github.com/kaizer666/ppa_list"> GitHub </a>. </br>
        Gradually I will make innovations in this project, as long as it is only an alpha version. Follow the news on my blog <a href="https://blog.kai-zer.ru"> https://blog.kai-zer.ru </a>
